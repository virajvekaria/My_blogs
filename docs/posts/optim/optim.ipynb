    "In the optimization world, optimizers play a crucial role in improving machine learning models. They adjust the model's settings to reduce the prediction errors, which are measured by the loss function.\n",

    "Optimizers come in two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "**First-Order Optimizers:** These *use partial derivative values* to guide the optimizer. They indicate if the loss is increasing or decreasing at a particular point, like a compass guiding the optimizer to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second-Order Optimizers:** These go further by *considering both first-order and second-order derivatives*. Delving deeper into the curvature of the loss function, they can, in some cases, achieve more efficient optimization. This provides deeper insights into the shape of the loss function, making optimization more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right optimizer can make a significant difference in the training speed and performance of machine learning models. For example, Gradient Descent is a widely used first-order optimizer, while more complex tasks may require second-order optimizers like Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS).\n",

    "## Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum's Intuition is that it confidently speeds up the convergence by accumulating the gradient of the past steps. It is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations as can be seen in Fig 1. It does this by adding a fraction of the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector. This fraction is called the momentum coefficient and is usually set to 0.9 or a similar value.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's akin to a ball rolling down a hill, gathering speed â€“ unlike standard SGD, which feels more step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",

    "- *Overshooting Reduction:* Consider a scenario where the current gradient points in a certain direction, but due to noise or complex curvature of the loss landscape, it may not be the best direction to move in the long term. Standard Momentum would keep accumulating velocity in the current direction, potentially overshooting the optimal solution. NAG anticipates that the parameters will move in the direction of the lookahead point, which allows it to \"course-correct\" by reducing the accumulated velocity in the original direction. This anticipatory adjustment helps in reducing overshooting.\n",

    "- *Noise Handling:* When gradients are noisy, they can cause erratic updates in standard Momentum. The lookahead mechanism of NAG dampens the impact of noisy gradients. By considering the gradient at the lookahead point, NAG effectively filters out some of the noise, resulting in more stable and reliable updates.\n",
